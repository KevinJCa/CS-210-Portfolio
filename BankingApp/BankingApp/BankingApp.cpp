* Description: The following program displays two static reports that show the year-end balances and year-end
* earned interests without additional monthly deposits. User input will determine the results by collecting
* the initial deposit, monthly deposits, annual interest, as well as the amount of years the two reports should
* be calculated for. The program was developed to demonstrate how a user's investments will grow over time.
