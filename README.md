# CS-Portfolio

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I developed an Airgead Banking app that is designed for users to see how their investments grow over time based on four factors: The initial investment, monthly deposits, interest percentage, and the number of years an investment will grow over time. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I made sure to create a clear and functional interface where the user would be prompted to input all the required amount of data in order to properly calculate their investement results over a period of time. Results are displayed neatly and in an organized manner on a chart with proper headings that accurately represent each value. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Input validation is one of the most important elements that should always be required within a program. It's a feature that I can implement to greatly reduce the amount of issues that could arise from a user that may accidentally or intentionally input a different value that should not be allowed. Along with implementing a dynamic interface that will display based on the overall size of all the values after calculating the results. There are currently times where bigger values fall off the entire chart and no longer appear organized.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging aspect of the project was properly obtaining the right calculations for the year-end balance and year-end earned interests values for every year. I began by first calculating these values by hand, using the proper formula to calculate the amount of money earned based on an annual interest rate inputted by the user. Afterwards, I looked back at every step I took to make those calculations and instead planned programatically in a step-by-step process to get those same results using functions. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

It served a great introduction using an object oriented approach towards developing an application that can be used as a useful financial resource for any user trying to observe their investments grow over time. The project's requirments put to use a theoritical company's coding standards that serves as an example of different formatting that as developers, we have to understand and adapt to whenever we begin working for several different companies within the industry over the course of our career.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried my best to make the program as efficient as possible with the minimum amount of code required to perform its task. Along with includiing plenty of in-line commenting to describe the purpose of every element within the program. Its primary functionality is carried with the use of different functions that reduce overall repetitiveness within the code.
